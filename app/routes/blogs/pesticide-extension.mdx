## What is Pesticide?

If you haven’t used it before, the google chrome extension Pesticide is a must have for any front end developer.  
The extension outlines all elements in the dom so you can easily see alignment and spacing.  
In can allow you to line things up on the page or even catch bugs when working with css.

## But can’t I just use my dev console to see an elements style?

While this is a good approach for finding detailed information about a certain element on a page, Pesticide is better to get an quick overview.  
I find using that by using Pesticide, I don’t have to open up the elements portion of my developer console near as much, saving me development time.  
Also, as projects get bigger, it can be hard to find the specific element you are looking for. With Pesticide, all elements are outlined so you don’t have to search for a specific one.

## Example Usage

Let’s look example to see pesticide in action.

- First, if you have not already, make sure to install Pesticide.
- After doing this, create a new folder call google-pesticide-example
- Open this folder in you favorite IDE. I will be using Visual Studio Code.
- Create a file called index.html in the folder and copy and paste this code into that file.
